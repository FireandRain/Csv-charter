# csv
This app allows the user to submit a given CSV file ( csv file to be used provided in the repo "csv-testfile.csv" ) which will be dynamically graphed into two chart forms. 

Each named element of each graph may be toggled on/off. 

Values to be plotted and Variables may be edited from the CVS directly or from the cvs file within an IDE.
If edited from within the IDE, the format must be adhered to.
